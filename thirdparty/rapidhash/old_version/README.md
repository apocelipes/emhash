rapidhashV1
====

**Fast**
Extremely fast for both short and large inputs.
The fastest hash function passing all tests in [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher?tab=readme-ov-file#smhasher).
The fastest hash function passing all tests in [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/b√•lob/main/results/README.md#passing-hashes).
About 6% higher throughput than wyhash according to SMHasher and SMHasher3 reports.

**Universal**
Optimized for both AMD64 and modern AArch64 systems.
Compatible with gcc, clang, icx and MSVC.
It does not use machine-specific vectorized or cryptographic instruction sets.
Prepared for both C and C++ compilation.

**Excellent**
Passes all tests in both [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/rapidhash.txt) and [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/raw/rapidhash.txt).
[Collision-based study](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#collision-based-hash-quality-study) showed a collision probability lower than wyhash and close to ideal.
Outstanding collision ratio when tested with datasets of 16B and 66B keys:

Collision-based hash quality study
-------------------------

A perfect hash function distributes its domain uniformly onto the image.
When the domain's cardinality is a multiple of the image's cardinality, each potential output has the same probability of being produced.
A function producing 64-bit hashes should have a $p=1/2^{64}$ of generating each output.

If we compute $n$ hashes, the expected amount of collisions should be the number of unique input pairs times the probability of producing a given hash.
This should be $(n*(n-1))/2 * 1/2^{64}$, or simplified: $(n*(n-1))/2^{65}$.
In the case of hashing $15*2^{30}$ (~16.1B) different keys, we should expect to see $7.03$ collisions.

We present an experiment in which we use rapidhash to hash $68$ datasets of $15*2^{30}$ (15Gi) keys each.
For each dataset, the amount of collisions produced is recorded as measurement.
Ideally, the average among measurements should be $7.03$ and its histogram should approximate a binomial distribution.
We obtained a mean value of $7.72$, just $9.8$% over $7.03$.
The results histogram, depicted below, does resemble a slightly inclined binomial distribution:

The same datasets were hashed using wyhash and its default seed $0$, yielding a higher mean collision value of $8.06$
The provided default seed was used to produce rapidhash results.
